## 💡 Sakchyam Thapa

### **Tagline**  
> **I build systems that think quietly and fail honestly.**

I work at the intersection of **Machine Learning** 🔵, **Retrieval Systems** 🟢, and **Backend Engineering** 🟣 — crafting software that survives contact with reality.

### 🔹 **Core Focus**
- **Turning imperfect data into reliable decisions** – transforming noise into actionable insights  
- **Designing retrieval systems that scale** – beyond demos to real-world impact  
- **Building resilient APIs and automation** – systems that remain stable under pressure

### 🌟 **Philosophy**
> “I believe the best systems are the ones you stop noticing once they’re deployed.”

I strive to create software that is **silent in execution, honest in behavior, and robust in the wild**.
