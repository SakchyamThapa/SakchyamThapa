I work at the intersection of **machine learning**, **retrieval systems**, and **backend engineering** — focusing on software that survives contact with reality.

My interests revolve around:
- Turning imperfect data into reliable decisions  
- Designing retrieval systems that scale beyond demos  
- Building APIs and automation that remain stable under pressure  

I believe the best systems are the ones you stop noticing once they’re deployed.
